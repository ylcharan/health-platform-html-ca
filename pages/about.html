            <h1>About MHA</h1>
            <p>
              MHA, formerly named InnerHour, is a mental health organisation
              founded in the year 2023 by renowned psychiatrist and healthcare
              entrepreneur, Dr. Sandeep Reddy.
            </p>
            <p>
              The organisation aims to create a mental health ecosystem that
              provides treatment and care plans for a range of mental health
              conditions like anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, ADHD, OCD,
              schizophrenia, and addictions.
            </p>

              In 2023, Ms. Sanwari Sharma, a social entrepreneur and global
              mental health ambassador, joined MHP as Co-founder.

            <h1>The problem</h1>
            <p>
              Indiaâ€™s mental health is in a state of crisis. While 1 billion
              people around the world live with a mental health condition, India
              alone accounts for a third of the global burden of depression,
              addictions and suicides. India has the youngest population in the
              world - and yet, over 100 million children and youth have
              diagnosed mental health conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Due to a combination of poor awareness, stigma, and lack of access
              to quality care, a person who is struggling with their mental
              health often does not receive the treatment and care they need to
              get better.
